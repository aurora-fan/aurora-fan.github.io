#### Here at AuroraFan, our goal is to design a new form of display, one different from the typical you see today. <br/> <br/>
#### If all goes well, we will have designed a display from a working fan, a motor, a sensor or two, and a handful of NeoPixels.<br/> <br/> We plan to attach several NeoPixel strips to two fan blades (in series), and spin these blades while simultaneously lighting up the pixels attached to it at the correct timing necessary to transform an image (or possibly, a moving picture) into a form viewable on the AuroraFan.<br/> <br/> Our project will be to create this working fan, and to work with slip ring technology to send both power and data to the NeoPixels, to light them up at the correct time, and with the correct color, to effecitvely create a backless display.<br/> <br/> We will also be using the Hall Effect Sensor as a feedback device for our PID algorithm, where this feedback loop will ensure that the motor is spinning at a constant speed, in order to achieve a crystal clear image.<br/> <br/> All together our efforts should result in a display that's both unique and accurate. <br/> <br/>
