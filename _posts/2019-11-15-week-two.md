Week two has come to a close and we've gathered all the components we've needed besides the plywood, screws, neopixels, and a couple of loose odds-and-ends. We hope to grab some plywood at The Home Depot next week and finalize a reservation for laser cutting the pieces. Stay tuned for next week, where we should have the pieces cut, and if we're lucky, we'll have the neopixels too!
