Week five is nearing its end and we've found ourselves not only making more progress... but more problems as well. We've gotten the Hall Effect Sensor working to some extent, however the image still slowly rotates, despite our best efforts. We've added a potentiometer for fine-tuning and calibrating, but this only works if we're consistently operating it, which is not ideal. To ammend this, we're trying a light sensor and LED combinator on both the opposite side of the blades and the base, though it's still a work-in-progress. <br/><br/> On the brighter side, we've started working on hardcoding some letters in the program which has been going well. We've also added a weather-based display to our roster, which if executed correctly, would be a great addition to our display. We're brainstorming more demos to show, though the RPM calibration still takes top priority. <br/><br/> Next week we hope to have some good news (hopefully about the RPM calibration), so we hope you tune in then to see our next update!
